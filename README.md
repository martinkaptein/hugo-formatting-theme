# hugo-formatting-theme

Ultra minimalist Formatting theme for hugo.

# Intended use

This is a very minimal and bare bones theme for hugo.
It is only intended to be used to produce beautifully formatted documents (like a "replacement" for pandoc).

These documents can then be exported using your Browser to other formats, like pdf.

This theme has literally nothing else, no menus or extra functionality.
 
# Installation

(in your hugo site directory)

```
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/martinkaptein/hugo-formatting-theme.git
```

Add `theme = "hugo-formatting-theme"` to your config file.

# Licensing and copyright

The `css` file this theme is build around, is not by me but comes from [this github thread](https://gist.github.com/killercup/5917178).
In that thread the license was not very clear.

Hence, the `styling.css` is by [this author](https://benjam.info/panam/) and the (default) `custom.css` [from here](https://gist.github.com/killercup/5917178).
